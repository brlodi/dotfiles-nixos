# Modular Awesome WM configuration

Awesome is pretty... well, awesome. Unfortunately the default sample config file is a messy, complex **564 line** behemoth that's frankly almost impossible to grok as a new user.

Luckily, a wonderful dev by the name of [Epsi R Nurwijayadi](http://epsi-rns.github.io/) took it upon himself to modularize that default configuration, complete with [extensive documentation](http://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2019/06/15/awesome-overview.html) of the reasoning for each choice he's made.

Everything in this directory is directly built upon his work, for which I am exceptionally grateful.

## Features

### Autogenerated applications menu

Awesome includes a dmenu-esque XDG-compatible application-launcher that can be summoned via <kbd>Mod4</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, but it's very barebones and only available as a horizontal menubar. I'm very much a keyboard+mouse user, rather than a keyboard-only user, so the fact it can _only_ be summoned by a keyboard shortcut is a secondary no-go.

However, thanks to the architecture of awesome, the machinery used to generate that menubar is available to other config files. The project [awesome-freedesktop](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-freedesktop) leverages that machinery to generate entries in a standard `awful.menu`, which can be made available via the awesome logo button as well as the right-click menu on the desktop.

The results can be seen below:
